## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is the Introductory challenge given by Frontend Mentor, so it was fairly simple to build.

Used sementic html elements where possible, instead of just putting `<div>` everywhere.

The following CSS property was useful in pushing the footer to the bottom, while keeping the main card in the centre, along with using flexbox.

```css
.container {
  margin: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

Would be looking into applying style for dark mode as well.
